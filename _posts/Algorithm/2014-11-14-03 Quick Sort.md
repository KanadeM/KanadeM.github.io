# Introduction

QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways. 

- Always pick first element as pivot.
- Always pick last element as pivot (implemented below)
- Pick a random element as pivot.
- Pick median as pivot.

## Partition Algorithm: 

![quick-sort-2](https://www.menglingjun.com/img/in-post/quick-sort2.png)

There can be many ways to do partition, following pseudo code adopts the method given in CLRS book. The logic is simple, we start from the leftmost element and keep track of index of smaller (or equal to) elements as i. While traversing, if we find a smaller element, we swap current element with arr[i]. Otherwise we ignore current element. 

### Pseudo Code for recursive QuickSort function:

```java
/* low  –> Starting index,  high  –> Ending index */

quickSort(arr[], low, high) {

    if (low < high) {

        /* pi is partitioning index, arr[pi] is now at right place */

        pi = partition(arr, low, high);

        quickSort(arr, low, pi – 1);  // Before pi

        quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high); // After pi

    }

}
```

### Pseudo code for partition()

```java
/* This function takes last element as pivot, places the pivot element at its correct position in sorted array, and places all smaller (smaller than pivot) to left of pivot and all greater elements to right of pivot */

partition (arr[], low, high)

{

    // pivot (Element to be placed at right position)
pivot = arr[high];  

 i = (low – 1)  // Index of smaller element and indicates the 
// right position of pivot found so far

for (j = low; j <= high- 1; j++){

 // If current element is smaller than the pivot
if (arr[j] < pivot){
i++;    // increment index of smaller element
 swap arr[i] and arr[j]
     }
 }

    swap arr[i + 1] and arr[high])
return (i + 1)
}
```

### Illustration of partition()

#### 1 Consider: arr[] = {10, 80, 30, 90, 40, 50, 70}

- Indexes:  0   1   2   3   4   5   6 
- low = 0, high =  6, pivot = arr[h] = 70
- Initialize index of smaller element, i = -1
